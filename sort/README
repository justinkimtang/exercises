---Implemntation of sorting algorithms for an integer array---
**************************************************************

Algorithms implemented:
    Bubble
        Cocktail
            Comb
                Counting
                    Heap
                        Insertion
                            Merge
                                Quick
                                    Selection

Test.java:
    Note: All algoritms to be tested must have a method sort(int[])
    Will run test on each algorithm listed and print out which algorithms
    passed and which ones failed. For failed test the first failed sort will
    also be printed. Custom test cases can also be added to customTest.txt.

    -Methods-
    List<int[]> getTestArrays()
        Returns an list of all test cases. Custom test can be added here
        or in customTest.txt.
    List<Class> getSortingMethods()
        Returns a list of the sorting algorithms to be tested. To add more
        algortims just add the class to be tested to sortingList.

customTest.txt
    File that further test can be added to. Format is as follows:
        -----------------------------------------
        Number of test cases
        Size of array1
        array1 contents seperated by a space
        Size of array2
        Contents of array2
        ... 

        ex.
            3
            2
            1 5
            5
            8 9 6 3 4
            1
            5
        ---------------------------------------
